We respectfully acknowledge that Waterton Lakes National Park is in the traditional territories of the Siksikaitsitapi, (Kainai, Piikani, Siksika and Amskapipikani). Waterton Lakes National Park falls within Treaty 7 territory which includes the Blackfoot Confederacy, the T’suutina Nation, the Stoney Nakoda Nation and the Metis Nation Region 3 Association’s homeland. The lands and waters of Waterton Lakes have been used for millennia by Indigenous Peoples for sustenance, ceremony, trade and travel. We thank them for their continuous stewardship.
